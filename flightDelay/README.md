# Travel Monkeys

Travel Monkeys is a Smart Contract that allows people, who want to travel by plane, to hedge their flights against the risk of a possible delay.

The project Travel Monkeys is about a Flight Delay Insurance that should help customers to automatically get compensation for a delayed flight without the need of paperwork.
The Insurance Company does not need to examine if a claim is valid. Therefore, the customers are able to receive the payment faster. This project should benefit both parties in saving time and efforts. 

The perfect insurance for you!

## Problem
Customers have to put a lot of work and effort to claim a compensation if their flight was delayed. This procedure is complicated and takes a lot of time. On the other hand the insurance company must check the validation of the claim as well. Customers might lose their right to claim for the payment if they do not apply for it on time.

## Solution
With an insurance as a smart contract the claim is secure. After taking out the flight delay policy both parties do not need to look after the fulfillment of the contract. The smart contract will automatically prove the conditions and trigger the payment. 

## Technologies
- Solidity
- Morpheus Labs
- React / Next
- Node.js
- Web3
- Truffle
- MetaMask

## Example

The following MockUps simulate the user interface of the insurance.

The insurance starts with entering the data of the customer as well as of the flight.

After applying the information the customer has to confirm the terms of the policy. He is able to chose the currency of the payout. With confirming the policy the customer gives his agreement and activates the smart contract.

The customer will receive a summary of his chosen policy.

## Review
This Smart Contract has been implemented as a part of the Blockchain & Solidity course. The main purpose was to learn the basics about Blockchain and Smart Contracts with the programming language Solidity on the platform Morpheus Labs SEED.

The implementation of this project hasn't been finished yet. The reasons are as follows:
- lack of time
- missing knowledge about the programming language
- working on a completely new platform
- not enough support available on the internet

Therefore a MockUp of the user-interface has been created for the purpose of the presentation.
