## Problem
Customers have to put a lot of work and effort to claim a compensation if their flight was delayed. This procedure is complicated and takes a lot of time. On the other hand the insurance company must check the validation of the claim as well. Customers might lose their right to claim for the payment if they do not apply for it on time.

## Solution
With an insurance as a smart contract the claim is secure. After taking out the flight delay policy both parties do not need to look after the fulfillment of the contract. The smart contract will automatically prove the conditions and trigger the payment.
